/**
 * Annotates a field or method as a type of {@link Rule} that can be invoked
 * across multiple VMs in a {@code DistributedTest}.
 *
 * If there are multiple annotated {@code DistributedRule}s on a class, they
 * will be applied in order of fields first, then methods. Furthermore, if
 * there are multiple fields (or methods) they will be applied in an order that
 * depends on your JVM's implementation of the reflection API, which is
 * undefined. Rules defined by fields will always be applied before Rules
 * defined by methods. You can use a {@link org.junit.rules.RuleChain} or
 * {@link org.apache.geode.test.junit.rules.RuleList} if you want to have
 * control over the order in which the Rules are applied.
 *
 * <p>
 * For example, here is a test class that makes a unique
 * {@link org.junit.rules.TemporaryFolder} available to each DUnit VM:
 * <pre>
 * {@literal @}Category(DistributedTest.class)
 * public class EachVMHasItsOwnTemporaryFolder {
 *
 *   {@literal @}DistributedRule
 *   public TemporaryFolder folder = new TemporaryFolder();
 *
 *   {@literal @}Rule
 *   public DistributedTestRule distributedTestRule = DistributedTestRule.builder().build();
 *
 *   {@literal @}Test
 *   public void eachVMHasItsOwnTemporaryFolder() throws Exception {
 *     Host.getHost(0).getVM(0).invoke(() -> {
 *       File gemfireProps = folder.newFile({@literal "}gemfire.properties{@literal "});
 *       File diskDirs = folder.newFolder({@literal "}diskDirs{@literal "});
 *       ...
 *     }
 *   }
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
